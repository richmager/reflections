What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Makes the thing so git can track your files, need to do it so that you can do the git version control ish. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It's the middle ground between too, it prepares the stage for the commit. I think it offers the value of adding different files to one commit that may be involved in one logical change to the code or whatever.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

By using the different diff commands to check what change has been made and to group different files in to one commit. 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

For each divergence. 

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

By showing how it works in a visual way. I hate this refleciton stuff. 

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

UGH
What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
