What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Makes the thing so git can track your files, need to do it so that you can do the git version control ish. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It's the middle ground between too, it prepares the stage for the commit. I think it offers the value of adding different files to one commit that may be involved in one logical change to the code or whatever.
